This is a simple to-do app with React & Redux, quite similar to the TodoMVC spec in terms of raw functionality.

This project includes unit tests written in Jest.js, mostly for the reducers thus far.

To run this project, simply use `yarn install && yarn start`. If you want to run the tests, just use `yarn run test` after the initial setup.

PS. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

**I used the official (and free) TodoMVC styling to focus on coding the React/Redux part of the app. The only thing I've done with the CSS is to translate them into styled-components for my own use. None of the CSS styles are my property, all credits go to their respective owners.**
