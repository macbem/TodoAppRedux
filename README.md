This is a simple to-do app with React & Redux, quite similar to the TodoMVC spec in terms of raw functionality.

This project includes unit tests written in Jest.js.

To run this project, simply use `yarn install && yarn start`. If you want to run the tests, just use `yarn run test` after the initial setup.

PS. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
